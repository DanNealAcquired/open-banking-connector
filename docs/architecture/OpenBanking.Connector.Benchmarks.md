# OpenBanking.Library.Connector.Benchmarks

Benchmarks is a standalone project intended to garner software performance benchmarks.

Itâ€™s intended to benchmark OpenBanking.Library.Connector code, and not the PISPs it integrates with. Its reports will help guide optimisation efforts and provide proof-of-quality to potential users.

## Implementation
* .Net Core 2.2  / C# 7 console application
* Incorporates BenchmarkDotNet (https://benchmarkdotnet.org/)

 
## Runtime profile
* Executed upon each build profiling with in-process mocks
* Executed upon integration test runs, for profiling against sandbox & live APIs

 
## Reports
For selected in-process code pathways:

* Mean/StdDev/Min/Max/Median execution times
* Memory & garbage collection pressure
* .Net Core 2.2 & (.Net Core 3 in future)

For selected sandbox APIs:

* Mean/StdDev/Min/Max/Median/Quartile execution times
* Memory & garbage collection pressure
* .Net Core 2.2 (.Net Core 3 in future)
