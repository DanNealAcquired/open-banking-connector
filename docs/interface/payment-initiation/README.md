# Payment Initiation

The `PaymentInitiation` interface allows you to create and read bank payments in Open Banking Connector.

It is based on v3.1.6 of the [UK Open Banking Read-Write Payment Initiation API](https://openbankinguk.github.io/read-write-api-site3/). Please see [here](../../supported-open-banking-apis.md) for more information on supported APIs. 

The functionality of the interface is described in the following pages:
