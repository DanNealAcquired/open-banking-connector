# Variable Recurring Payments

The `VariableRecurringPayments` interface allows you to create and read variable recurring bank payments in Open Banking Connector.

It is based on v3.1.8 of the [UK Open Banking Read-Write Variable Recurring Payments  API](https://openbankinguk.github.io/read-write-api-site3/v3.1.8/profiles/vrp-profile.html). 

The functionality of the interface is described in the following pages:
