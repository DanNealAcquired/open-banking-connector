In this section, we describe how to get started with Open Banking Connector.

The following basic steps will enable you to get Open Banking Connector up and and running and create a registration
with a bank:

1. [Set up basic configuration](./set-up-basic-configuration/README.md#set-up-basic-configuration)
2. [Run the Open Banking Connector container](./run-container/README.md)
3. [Add a software statement, certificates and an encryption key description](./add-software-statement-etc/README.md)
