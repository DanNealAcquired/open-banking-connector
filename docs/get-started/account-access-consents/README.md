# Account access consents

In this section, we describe how to get started with account access consents which allow access to account data.

With a bank registration that supports account information retrieval, you
can [create and authorise an account access consent](./create-and-authorise-account-access-consent/README.md).

Once an account access consent is authorised, you can use it
to [get account data](./get-account-data/README.md).
