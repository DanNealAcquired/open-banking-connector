# Open Banking Connector

Open Banking Connector (OBC) is open-source software that manages your connections to UK Open Banking APIs.

OBC can be used as a connection layer (library) by backend software to connect to UK banks or standalone as a system for testing "liveness" of bank APIs. We plan to develop it so it can function as the main component of a mobile app backend.

Specifically the software:
* Handles creation and management of bank clients
* Manages user tokens associated with consents
* Supports API mapping for banks using older Open Banking API versions
* Supports overrides and specialised behaviour for compatibility with banks

The main purpose of OBC is to save you the time and expense of building your own Open Banking connectivity stack.
