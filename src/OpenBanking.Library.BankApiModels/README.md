# Bank API Models

This project contains bank API models generated using [AutoRest](https://github.com/Azure/autorest) from Swagger/Open API source files.

The Swagger/Open API source files come from the following two repos:
- https://github.com/OpenBankingUK/client-registration-api-specs
- https://github.com/OpenBankingUK/read-write-api-specs

whose copyright holder is the UK Open Banking Implementation Entity and which are made available under the MIT licence (see footer of this [page](https://standards.openbanking.org.uk/api-specifications/)).

The first version of the file `src\OpenBanking.Library.BankApiModels\UkObRw\V3p1p8\Vrp\vrp-swagger.json` was created by converting https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenBankingUK/read-write-api-specs/v3.1.8r4/dist/openapi/vrp-openapi.json from Open API v3 to v2 using the https://github.com/LucyBot-Inc/api-spec-converter tool.
