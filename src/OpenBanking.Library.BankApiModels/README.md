# Bank API Models

This project contains bank API models generated using [AutoRest](https://github.com/Azure/autorest) from Swagger/Open API source files.

The Swagger/Open API source files come from the following two repos:
- https://github.com/OpenBankingUK/client-registration-api-specs
- https://github.com/OpenBankingUK/read-write-api-specs

whose copyright holder is the UK Open Banking Implementation Entity and which are made available under the MIT licence (see footer of this [page](https://standards.openbanking.org.uk/api-specifications/)).
